# LearningProgress

###与其感慨路难行，不如马上出发。

As a test of ability.

## 2015

#### 11.12
The day right after the Single's Day, a man determined to learn some coding stuff at the ending of shopping. Then create a github account as the beginning of it.

Hope it will be a fresh button of my life.

test test lol~


####11.18

merge two branches to have a better mood of learning.

####11.30

End of November, Realize that the efficiency of learning from the video site is too low, then get some books of JavaScript from the library. Thanks to XMU. lol~

####12.1

Get the "Professional JavaScript for Web Development" as a present from my GF. Happy day.

####12.10

Find an impressive jekyll theme made by Hux, hope can be that level someday.

####12.30

Get a demo request from WQQ. Prepare to do it when I am free.

####End of the year

Actually through the less than 2 month learning, I realize that coding is hard. Learning a code language as a ME guraduated has so many unknown CS basis is hard. Using the Linux, getting and congfiguring a suitable IDE is hard. Building a demo, then publishing it edured the shy is hard.

But I think I love it.

The strong emotion after u release your code is fantastic. Doing everything useful and having bunches knowledge new to learn is awesome.

The open source environment of JavaScript development community is realy the thing I love.

## 2016

#### The vacation

During the Chinese New Year Vacation, the demo which WQQ request me was done. For the first time I use the bootstrap and fullpage.js to build it. In addition to note, the responsive works not very well and as a rookie of front-end engineering, I left a lot of works to be done.

#### 2.14

Valentine's Day is the first day of the new term. hoho~

Still so much to learn.

Willing to do some md notes of basis of JavaScript. Hope that will help me to work it out.

#### 3.1

Be aware of some internship recruits. Time to do something for job-hunting.

Be honestly, the level of coding skill is pretty much low. Need some time to improve.

Tools has a great part of front-end engineering. So much documents need to be read.

#### 3.22

Netease? I think it is not going to pass.

#### 4.03

Tencent? Not going to pass too...

The flu and the headache with it almost kill me..

The Tomb-sweeping Day Vacation of 2016 is the worst vacation I ever have. Seeing to much about the difficulties of being

a front-end engineer, honestly, I am kind of frustrated.

Doing a little diary work to maintain my current streak. Vain creature!
